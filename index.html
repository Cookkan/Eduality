        <p>WHY?</p>
        <p class ="footer-1">Girls face inequalities from birth that can persist throughout their lives, 
            including in education.
            <i> Access to education and educational opportunities </i> are 
            critical for equipping individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to 
            thrive in the modern world. However, gender disparities in education persist for 
            various reasons, preventing girls from accessing the same opportunities as boys.
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore, addressing the gap in education equality between genders is crucial 
            in order to promoting equality, ensuring that all individuals have the opportunity to reach their full potential.
