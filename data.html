        <p class="caption">School life expectancy represents the total number of years a person is expected to spend in formal education. From 2000 to 2019, this number has continuously increased in all region. Still, in most regions, the school life expectancy of male is higher than that of female. <br> <br>Globally, the school life expectancy of male is 10.61 while that of female is 10.40. Increasing the school life expectancy of both sexes is crucial to ensure equal access and opportunities for all.</p>

    <div class="middle-content">
        <p class="caption">The out of school rate reflects the percent of students unenrolled in formal education. The general trend seen across all regions is that this rate is continuously decreasing, suggesting that there has been an increase in accessibility to educational opportunities. <br> <br>However, this rate is significantly higher in Sub-Saharan Africa with an overall rate of 56.4% compared to that of the world, 35.2%. In some regions, the out of school rate for males is higher than that of females, possibly relating to the demand for male workforce in child labor (ILO 2021). Governments can decrease the out of school rate by regulating child labor and alocating monnetary funds for the development and building of more schools. </p>

        <p class="caption">The literacy rate is the percentage of the given population that can read and write. The global literacy rate is 91.73% where female's literacy rate is 90.53% and male's literacy rate is 92.85%. Sub-Saharan Africa is the lowest on the list with an average of 76.32% across both sexes. Although the global literacy rate can still be improved in various ways, the data, as of 2019, marks significant development in the global literacy rate throughout the centuries. </p>
